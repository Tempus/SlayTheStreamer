A Twitch Integration mod for Slay the Spire, aimed towards a 'Chat vs Streamer' style gameplay.

An extension for Twitch Integration. Converts the base game to 'Slay the Streamer', a mode where the streamer gets a sealed deck to start, and chat plays the role of the enemy and tries to actively make the deck worse to cause the streamer to lose. Features voting on Neow, voting on the Act Boss, monsters are named after chat, and chat monsters can speak through the game when alive.
